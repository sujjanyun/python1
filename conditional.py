#Hey, hi Python !! 
#Does what the user typed (user_input) match the magic number (MAGIC_NUMBER)?
#If it does, will you please tell the user: "WHOA! Are you a mind reader?"
#If it doesn't, will you please tell the user: "Sorry, try again next time."
#And then you can stop running the program
#Thanks Python!!!
